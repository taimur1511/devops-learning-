# Users and Groups 
Linux uses users and groups to manage access to files, directories and system resources.

## Users 
A user account represents an individual or service that can interact with a Linux system.

Each user has their own account and permissions.

## Creating a user

The `useradd` command can be used to create a new user.

`useradd` username

## Viewing users
The `/etc/passwd` file contains information about user accounts on the system.

The cat command can be used to view its contents:

`cat` /etc/passwd

## Groups
Groups are used to organise users and manage permissions.

A user can belong to one or more groups.

##Creating a group
The `groupadd` command can be used to create a new group.

`groupadd` groupname

## Adding a user to a group
The `usermod` command can be used to modify a users account. The `-aG` options can be used to add a user to an existing group.

`usermod -aG` groupname username

## Checking group membership

The `groups` command shows the groups that a user belongs to.

`groups` username

## Practical Example
I practised creating a new user and group using Killercoda.

- I first created a group called `linux-group`:

- `groupadd linux-group`

- I then created a user called `linux-user`:

- `useradd linux-user`

- Next, I added linux-user to the linux-group supplementary group:

- `usermod -aG linux-group linus-user`

- Used the `groups` command to check which groups the user belonged to:

`groups linux-user`

The output showed:

`linux-user : linux-user linux-group`

- This shows that linux-user belongs to both its primary group, `linux-user`, and the supplementary group, `linux-group`.

- I then used the `id` command to view more detailed information about the user:

`id linux-user`

The output was:

uid=1002(linux-user) gid=1003(linux-user) groups=1003(linux-user),1002(linux-group)

This showed the user's UID, primary GID and group memberships.
